My project with Creative Commons(CC) is _extending the scope and/or usage of CC Vocabulary_. What is Vocabulary and what does it mean to extend its scope and usage? I will try to explain this in the simplest form.

## What is Vocabulary?

Vocabulary is Creative Commons’s web design system. This project was originally started by my mentors [Dhruv Bhanushali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhruvkb/) and [Hugo Solar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugosolar/) to unify all of CC websites and applications.

Vocabulary comprised of reusable UI components and an interactive playground built with Storybook.

## What does it mean to extend its scope and usage?

This means using Vocabulary’s UI components to rebuild or revamp CC websites and platforms. Since Vocabulary provides a shared library of reusable components and guidelines, building products and maintenance becomes easier and much faster.

## My Project Progress so far

Vocabulary initially comprised of UI components built with Vue.js and a live styleguide built with Styleguidist. My first task was to create an interactive playground experience with Storybook which should replace live styleguide built with Styleguidist.

_Styleguidist and Storybook are both open-source tools for developing UI components. You can read up about them._

A live version of the interactive playground I contributed to building can be seen [here](https://cc-vocabulary.netlify.app/).

Next, I will be working on building the same functional UI components with vanilla JavaScript for other CC websites that are not built with Vue.

## You Can Also Contribute

Vocabulary has been undergoing a lot of changes lately. We welcome anyone who wishes to contribute to its development. Its GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/creativecommons/vocabulary).
