When COVID-19 struck, students in my home country Nigeria were preparing to take
A-level examinations to graduate from secondary schools and enable them to gain
admission into tertiary institutions. As we all went indoors and were bored out
of our minds, I discovered that there was no easy and fun way to help these
students continue to study for their examinations.

## Purpose and Goal

My goal is to build to fun educational quiz app to help these students practice
for their examinations and **for free**. Also, I wanted it to be accessible to
students with slow internet service.

## Design

I gathered ideas from my favorite quiz apps: Quizizz, Kahoot, and Elevate. And
did a hand sketch of the wireframes and user flow for the app.

## Development

<u>Frontend</u>: The frontend is built with **React** and **TypeScript**.
Initially, most of the code was written in JavaScript but I switched to
TypeScript because of its benefits especially with static typing and spotting
bugs early. The app is also a **progressive web app** because I wanted it to be
accessible to most students with slow internet service.

<u>Backend</u>: To access questions of major exams in Nigeria, I used the [ALOC
Endpoints API](https://questions.aloc.ng/).

<u>Deployment</u>: **Netlify** was used.

## Takeaways

I have learned a lot from working on this project; from improving my proficiency
with React to learning design. Yeah, I have been learning product and UX design.
This project is still a work in progress and I have resolved to do the following
before my next prototype.

- carry out user research to understand fully my users' first.

- revamp the UI based on the user research since one of the goals is to make the
  app fun.

- do more testing with actual users.
