The _useEffect_ hook is one of the most important react hooks but also one of
the most misused. Part of the confusion comes with its name. A better name would
have been _useSynchronize_. This is because the mental model of the
`useEffect()` is for <u>synchronization</u> of some effects not for running all
effects. Let me explain further.

According to the latest react docs :

> Effects should usually synchronize your components with an external system. If
> there’s no external system and you only want to adjust some state based on
> another state, you might not need an Effect.

This means that the `useEffect()` lets you run some code after rendering so that
you can synchronize your component with some system outside of React. These
systems outside of React introduce <u>Side-Effects</u>. Side-effects or effects
for short are other things that happen in your react application that are not
related to UI rendering. Examples include: sending HTTP requests to the server,
storing data in browser storage, or running timers or intervals functions.

Some side-effects happen as a result of rendering and some as a result of a user
event. For example, in a chat application, sending a message in the chat (a POST
request) is a side-effect caused by an event because it is directly caused by
the user clicking a specific button. However, setting up a server connection to
a chat-room is a side-effect caused by rendering because it should happen after
rendering the chat-room component.

## You do not need to do the following in a useEffect

### 1. Updating state

You do not need a `useEffect()` if you want to update a component’s state
corresponding to some props or state change. This is because setting state in a
`useEffect()` causes unnecessary re-render.

```js
❌

const Form = () => {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState("Chidi")
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState("Onye")

  // Avoid: redundant state and unnecessary effect
  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState("")
  useEffect(() => {
    setFullName(firstName + " " + lastName)
  }, [firstName, lastName])
  // ...
}
```

Remove the `useEffect()` and the redundant state variable.

```js
✅

const Form = () => {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Chidi');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Onye');

  // Good: calculated during rendering
  const fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;
  // ...
}
```

### 2. Caching expensive calculations

```js
❌

const Cart = () => {
  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);

  // Avoid: 'total' is a redundant state and Effect is unnecessary
  const [total, setTotal] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    setTotal(items.reduce((currentTotal, item) => {
    return currentTotal + item.price;
    },0);
  }, [items]);

  // ...
}
```

Since `total` is a derived value, remove it from a `useEffect()` and use a
`useMemo()` if your derived calculations are expensive.

```js
✅

const Cart = () => {
  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);
  const total = items.reduce((currentTotal, item) => {
    return currentTotal + item.price;
    },0);
  // ...
}
```

```js
✅

const Cart = () => {
  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);
  const total = useMemo(() => {
    // Does not re-run unless 'items' changes
   items.reduce((currentTotal, item) => {
    return currentTotal + item.price;
    },0),
   [items]);
  // ...
}
```

### 3. Subscribing to an external store

If your component needs to subscribe to some external store, the usual practice
is to implement this in a `useEffect()` but there is a better solution.

```js
✅

const useConnectionStatus = () => {
  const [isConnected, setIsConnected] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const sub = storeApi.subcribe(({status}) => {
    setIsConnected(status === 'connected');
    });
    return () => {
      sub.unsubscribe();
    };
  }, []);

  return isConnected;
}
```

A preferred solution would be to use `useSyncExternalStore`; a purpose-built
react hook for subscribing to an external store

```js
✅ ✅

const useConnectionStatus = () => {
  return useSyncExternalStore(
    storeApi.subcribe, // subscribe
    () => storeApi.getStatus() === 'connected', // get snapshot
    () => true // get server snapshot
  );
}
```

### 4. Initializing your application

You do not need `useEffect()` to execute effects that run once when your app
starts.

```js
❌

const App = () => {
  // Avoid: Effects with logic that should only ever run once
  useEffect(() => {
    authenticateUser();
  }, []);
  // ...
}
```

Since the effect runs once as your application starts, put it outside your `App`
component.

```js
✅

if (typeof window !== 'undefined') { // Check if we're running in the browser.
  authenticateUser();  // Only runs once per app load
}

const App = () => {
  // ...
}
```

### 5. Handling Fire Once User Events

User events that fire once on demand should be placed in an event handler and
not in the useEffect hook.

```js
❌

const UsersList = ({ users }) => {
  const [newUser, setNewUser] = useState({
    firstname: "",
    surname: ""
  });

  const handleAddNewUser = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    // This updates the users
    addNewUser(newUser);
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    handleAddNewUser()
  }, [users.count]);

  return (
    <>
      <h2> Enter a new user </h2>
      <form onSubmit>
      // ...
      </form>
      <Users users={users} />
    </>
  )
  // ...
}
```

```js
✅

const UsersList = ({ users }) => {
  const [newUser, setNewUser] = useState({
    firstname: "",
    surname: ""
  });

  const handleAddNewUser = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    addNewUser(newUser);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h2> Enter a new user </h2>
      <form onSubmit={handleAddNewUser}>
      // ...
      </form>
      <Users users={users} />
    </>
  )
  // ...
}
```

### 6. Fetching data

This is the biggest misuse I have seen. API calls should be placed in a
useEffect hook ... RIGHT??? ...NOT REALLY.

Fetched data will be used to update a particular state. And updating a state in
a `useEffect()` might cause unnecessary re-renders. We do not want this.

When you fetch data as a result of a user event like clicking on a button, your
fetch function should be placed in the event handler.

```js
❌

const SearchPage = () => {
  const [results, setResults] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchResults().then(json => {
      setResults(json);
    });
  }, []);

  // ...
}
```

```js
✅

const SearchPage = () => {
  const [results, setResults] = useState([]);

  const handleSearchResult = () => {
    fetchResults().then(json => {
      setResults(json);
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleSearchResult}> search </button>
      <h2> Your search results </h2>
      <SearchResults reuslts ={results}/>
    </>
  )
  // ...
}
```

There are cases where you need to fetch data as a page loads, your fetch
function can be placed in a `useEffect()` but you should also add a cleanup
function.

```js
✅

const SearchPage = () => {
  const [results, setResults] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    let ignore = false;

      fetchResults().then(json => {
        if (!ignore) {
        setResults(json);
        }
      });
    // cleanup function
    return () => {
      ignore = true;
    };
  }, []);
  // ...
}
```

But this is not the best solution because it does not take care of race
conditions, caching, error handling, network waterfalls, and more. A better
solution would be to use a framework or library that handles all these issues
like React Query, SWR, Remix, etc.

```js
✅ ✅

import {useQuery} from 'react-query';

const SearchPage = () => {
  const {data:results, isLoading, isError} = useQuery('results', fetchResults());
  // ...
}
```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## So where can you use a useEffect?

The `useEffect()` is specifically for <u>synchronization</u> with side-effects
that are caused by rendering. Simply put, the useEffect hook is for effects that
will need to synchronize depending on changes in a component's reactive values
(props, state and values derived from props or state) which will be added to the
useEffect dependency array.

One golden rule I follow before using the useEffect hook is this:

> If your side-effect logic can execute outside a useEffect hook without causing
> unnecessary re-rendering, then you might not need a `useEffect()`.

Below are a few cases where you might need a useEffect hook.

### 1. Subscribing to events

When you subscribe to an event, there should be a corresponding cleanup
function. This is better done in a `useEffect()`.

```js
const App = () => {
  const handleScroll = event => {
    console.log(window.scrollX, window.scrollY)
  }
  useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll)
    // cleanup this component
    return () => window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll)
  }, [])
}
```

### 2. Controlling non-React UIs

There are cases where you might want to control the parameters of imported UI
libraries like maps. A useEffect hook might be the best place to do this.

```js
const App = () => {
  const mapRef = useRef(null)
  const [zoom, setZoom] = useState(1)

  useEffect(() => {
    const map = mapRef.current
    map.setZoomLevel(zoom)
  }, [zoom])
  // ...
}
```

This also includes running things like animations on page load.

```js
import { runFireworks } from 'runFireworks'

const SuccessPage = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    runFireworks()
  }, [])
  // ...
}
```

### 3. Controlling Timer functions

```js
const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  useEffect(() => {
    // Implementing the setInterval method
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(count + 1)
    }, 1000)
    // Clearing the interval
    return () => clearInterval(interval)
  }, [count])

  return <h1>{count}</h1>
}
```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## In Summary

- `useEffect()` is for synchronization.

- If there is no external system involved, you shouldn’t need a `useEffect()`.

- If the side-effect logic can execute outside the useEffect hook, you shouldn’t
  need a `useEffect()`.

- If your implementation of `useEffect()` causes unnecessary render, you are
  probably using it wrong.

- Use `useEffect()` sapringly.
